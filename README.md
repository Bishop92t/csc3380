Work in progress. Compiles and runs under Netbeans or Eclipse, to compile under a prompt you'll have to remove the first actual line of each class. Still needs to be debugged and cleaned up.


Original idea:
The idea is to create a program that will calculate how many of each class book the book store needs to order. It will first look at a list of books. It will then look at the first book in the list and then searches another list, which will contain each class and the books required for that class, for all classes that need the currently selected book. It will then check for how many students are in each class that need that book and calculate how many students combined are in those classes. It will then check how many copies of the selected book that the book store currently has in stock of that book, and then it will compare the number of students total to the number of books the store currently has and  take the difference. It will then repeat this process for each book in the list until it goes through all the books in the list of books. Once it has finished, It will then print out how many of each book needs to be ordered in either, a different document, or on the screen. Now, we can add more things like price calculation later one, but this should be a good start
